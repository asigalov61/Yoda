# Yoda Training Code

***

## Two versions to choose from:

### 1) Yoda_Maker = OpenAI's GPT3 + Google's RGA(RPR)
#### This version is great for small-scale models and small-scale datasets

### 2) Sparse_Yoda_Maker = Sparse Transformer technology which was used to create OpenAI's MuseNet
#### This is absolutely required for large-scale models and large-scale datasets
